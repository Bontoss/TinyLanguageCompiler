# TinyLanguage Compiler
## Description
The TinyLanguage Compiler is a project from a Compiler Theory course, implementing a parser and scanner for TinyLanguage, a simple programming language. It includes a lexical analyzer (scanner) and a syntax analyzer (parser) to convert TinyLanguage source code into executable machine code or an intermediate representation.

## Features
* **Scanner (Lexical Analyzer):** Recognizes and tokenizes input source code into a stream of tokens.
* **Parser (Syntax Analyzer):** Parses the token stream generated by the scanner according to the grammar rules of TinyLanguage.
* **Error Handling:** Detects and reports lexical and syntax errors in the source code.
* **Intermediate Representation:** Optionally generates an intermediate representation (e.g., Abstract Syntax Tree, Intermediate Code) for further processing.
