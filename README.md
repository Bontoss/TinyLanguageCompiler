# TinyLanguage Compiler
The TinyLanguage Compiler is an implementation of a parser and scanner for a simple language called TinyLanguage. It was developed as part of a Compiler Theory course project.

## Description
The TinyLanguage Compiler project aims to implement a basic compiler for TinyLanguage, a simple programming language with a limited set of features. The compiler consists of a scanner (lexical analyzer) and a parser (syntax analyzer) to convert source code written in TinyLanguage into executable machine code or an intermediate representation.

## Features
* **Scanner (Lexical Analyzer):** Recognizes and tokenizes input source code into a stream of tokens.
* **Parser (Syntax Analyzer):** Parses the token stream generated by the scanner according to the grammar rules of TinyLanguage.
* **Error Handling:** Detects and reports lexical and syntax errors in the source code.
* **Intermediate Representation:** Optionally generates an intermediate representation (e.g., Abstract Syntax Tree, Intermediate Code) for further processing.
